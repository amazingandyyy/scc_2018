I came to your page and noticed you could have a lot more visitors. I have found that the key to running a popular website is making sure the visitors you are getting are interested in your niche. There is a company that you can get traffic from and they let you try the service for free. I managed to get over 300 targetted visitors to day to my website. Check it out here: http://nsru.net/018a

Greetings OCF members,

In an effort to increase the quality of our offered services, the OCF
Board of Directors is making changes to our printing and email
services.

We recommend checking our blog and subscribing to the feed for further updates:
http://status.ocf.berkeley.edu/

## Printing
in 6A Hearst Gym
http://status.ocf.berkeley.edu/2013/10/printing-service-changes.html

As an organization managed and operated entirely by student
volunteers, we don't have the financial resources, equipment, or
facility space to sustain our current and projected levels of printing
demand.

In an effort to reduce costs and increase reliability, printing is now
limited to 10 pages/day on weekdays. OCF may make additional changes
to printing policy this semester and future semesters to manage
increasing printing demand.

## Email
@ocf.berkeley.edu
http://status.ocf.berkeley.edu/2013/10/email-service-changes.html

Email services are being phased out over the next few months.

### Phase 1: Forward-only

After October 20, OCF email service will become forward-only. Email
that is stored on OCF servers will be deleted.

### Phase 2

At a future date, incoming and outgoing email will be rejected. Groups
with virtual hosts (e.g., @group.berkeley.edu) are **excluded** from
this phase.

We welcome feedback in person during our weekly meetings on Thursdays
at 8pm in the California Conference Room (across the lab). Please do
not reply to this email.

Thanks for reading,
Your friendly staff volunteers at the OCF
You have received this announcement to update you about important
changes to the OCF. The Open Computing Facility is an all-volunteer
student organization providing free shell accounts, disk space, web
hosting, and printing from a lab, lounge, and server room in
Hearst Gym, UC Berkeley.
